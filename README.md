# Movie Recommendation System Using ML

🎬 This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

📝 The movie recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical movie ratings. The goal is to enhance the user experience by suggesting relevant movies and improving user engagement.

🍿 The recommendation system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to generate accurate movie recommendations. Collaborative filtering analyzes user behavior and preferences, while content-based filtering considers movie attributes and characteristics.

## Dataset

📊 The project utilizes a comprehensive movie dataset containing information about movies, user ratings, and user profiles. The dataset includes attributes such as movie genres, release year, cast and crew, user ratings, and user demographic information.

## Model Development

🔧 Various machine learning algorithms are employed to develop the recommendation system, including matrix factorization methods, clustering techniques, and deep learning approaches. The models are trained on the movie dataset to capture user preferences and movie similarities.

## Evaluation Metrics

📈 The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (MAP). Additionally, user feedback and user satisfaction surveys may be used to assess the system's effectiveness in providing relevant and personalized movie recommendations.

## Dependencies

🛠️ The project relies on the following libraries and frameworks:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy 🧮
- pandas 🐼
- scikit-learn 🧪
- TensorFlow / PyTorch 🧠 (optional, if using deep learning models)
- Matplotlib 📊

## Getting Started

🚀 To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the movie dataset (provide a link or instructions on where to obtain the dataset).
4. Preprocess the dataset (provide instructions if any preprocessing is required).
5. Train the recommendation models: `python train.py`
6. Generate movie recommendations for a user: `python recommend.py --user_id=<user_id>`
   (Provide instructions on how to input user preferences if applicable)

📝 Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different algorithms and techniques to improve the movie recommendation accuracy.
